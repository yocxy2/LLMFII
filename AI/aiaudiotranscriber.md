## 🥊CI/CD

(**Preferred Pipeline Using GitHub Actions for Docker Image**)

<p align = "center"><img src = "./assets/doc_assets/Docker_CICD.png" height = 300 width = 450 alt = "Docker CI/CD"></p>


## ⚒️ Set-Up Instructions

<p align = "center"><img src = "./assets/doc_assets/setup.gif" height = 300 alt = "SetUp Icon"></p>



- Open your terminal / command prompt. 

- Clone the repository 
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/smaranjitghose/AIAudioTranscriber.git
    ```
- Change the directory to the cloned project
    
    ```
    cd AIAudioTranscriber
    ```

#### **A. Without using Docker**

- Ensure you have any version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) below 3.10 installed in your system and you have ``virtualenv`` package installed

    ```
    which python
    ```

    ```
    pip install virtualenv
    ```

- Create a new virtual environment
    ```
    python -m venv env
    ```

- Activate virtual enviroment
    - On Mac/Linux
        ```terminal
        source env/bin/activate
        ```
    - On Windows
        ```terminal
        env/Scripts/Activate.ps1 
        ```

- Install ffmpeg in your local syste,
    - On Windows using [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/)
        ```terminal
        choco install ffmpeg
        ```
    - On MacOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
        ```terminal
        brew install ffmpeg 
        ```
    - On Debian/Ubuntu
        ```terminal
        sudo apt update && sudo install ffmpeg
        ```
    - On Arch Linux
        ```terminal
        sudo pacman -S ffmpeg 
        ```

- Install the dependencies

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Download the model weights (This will take a few minutes since the total size of models in gigabytes)

    ```
    python get_model_weights.py
    ```

- Run the Web application
    ```
    streamlit run .\Home.py
    ```
    > **Note**:
    > - If the app does not load by itself in your default browser, open a browser of your choice and navigate to  `http://localhost:8501`
    > - To stop the application, press `CTRL + C` in your terminal

#### **B. Using Docker**

- Make sure you have Docker installed on your system. Refer the documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) if you need assistance setting up.
- Build a docker image
    ```
    docker run -t aitranscriber:v0.0.4 .
    ```
    > **Note**:
    > - You may give any name instead of aitranscriber and any tag instead of v0.0.4
    > - Depending on your system it takes a few minutes to successfully build the image
- Once complete, check the docker image
    ```
    docker images
    ```
- Create and run a Docker Container for the image
    ```
    docker run -p 8501:8501 aitranscriber:v0.0.4
    ```
    > **Note**:
    > - `docker run -p <hostport>:<8501> <container_name>:<tag_name>`
    > - In the above command, you can play around with which port of your host system you wish to map to the 8501 port of the container 
    > - If you used a different docker image name and/or different tag, make sure to update it in the command
- Open your preferred Web Browser and navigate to ``http://localhost:8501`` 
    > **Note**:
    > - If you used a different host port in the above command then navigate to that one, ``http://localhost:<host_port>``
    > - To stop the container, in the terminal check the containter name: ``docker ps --all``
    > - Now use container name with the command:  ``docker stop <container_name>``

## ✏️ Note 

<p align = "center"><img src = "./assets/doc_assets/notes.gif" height = 300 alt = "Note Icon"></p>

- To view the generated transcript file(s) in VS Code IDE install [Subtitles Editor](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pepri.subtitles-editor) extension
- To extensively edit/manipulate the generated transcript file(s) use the open source tool [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit) 
- For Streamlit Sharing, mentioning versions of the modules in requirements throws error at times
- Large Modelv2 outperforms all other versions of Whisper in terms of performance especially in Multi-lingual Transcription. However, it takes a 10 times more V-RAM than the base model and has longer inference time
- To quickly record audio from system microphone use [this](https://github.com/smaranjitghose/miscellaneous/blob/master/handypython/data/audio/audio_recording.py) Python Script:
    - Pre-requisities:

        ```
        pip install pyaudio wave
        ```
- Whisper is unable to read audio file from disk if ``python-ffmpeg`` or ``ffmpeg`` python pacakges are installed. It only works when ``ffmpeg-python`` python package is installed and not the former too

    ```
    # Remove all ffmpeg related python packages
    pip uninstall python-ffmpeg ffmpeg ffmpeg-python
    # Install the appropriate pacakge for ffmpeg
    pip install ffmpeg-python

    ```
- [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/) has a great collection of copyright free, no royalty songs that one can use for testing the application
- Poor Performance for Kanada or Telegu songs (often language recognition itself fails) for base model. Example: Kantara movie's [Varaha Roopam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gH_RYRwVrVM) Song

#### Docker Container and CI/CD

- Exclude as much irrelevant files as possible with ```.dockerignore``` such as README.MD, LICENSE, snapshots, notebooks, input,output,logs, etc

- Minimize the number of layers (Created by RUN, COPY and ADD)
- Always combine ``RUN apt-get update`` with ``apt-get install`` in the same RUN statement. Using ``apt-get update`` alone in a RUN statement causes caching issues and subsequent ``apt-get install`` instructions fail.

- Using ``RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y`` ensures your Dockerfile installs the latest package versions with no further coding or manual intervention. This technique is known as “cache busting”. 

- In addition, when you clean up the apt cache by removing ``/var/lib/apt/lists`` it reduces the image size, since the apt cache is not stored in a layer. 

- Python Docker Image Info:
    - Images tagged with `stretch`/`buster`/`jessie`/`buster`/`bullseye` are codenames for different [Debian Operating System](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianReleases) Production releases.
    - `bullseye` being version 11, buster being version 10, and so on. (2022) 
    - `bookworm`, `trixy` and `forky` are work-in-progress releases which may not be stable yet
    - `-slim` - only installs the minimal packages needed to run the particular tool.

- Base Image with python <= 3.9 raises [issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71712258/error-could-not-build-wheels-for-backports-zoneinfo-which-is-required-to-insta/71735458#71735458) with module `backports.zoneinfo`and pip fails


- To build and test multi-architecture docker images locally,
    - Create a new buildx instance
        ```
        docker buildx create --use
        ```
    - Build a new docker image for multi-architecture support
        ```
         docker buildx build --platform linux/arm64,linux/amd64 -t aitranscriber:multi-architecture -f Dockerfile . 
        ```

- Checking Docker Image Build for multi-architecture is too time consuming for the current application and disabled
